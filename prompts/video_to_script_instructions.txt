You are given a TikTok video, the video has 3 main elements we are interested in:
- Audio:
Use "" to denote text spoken by different characters in the scene. ("This shirt is great!")
Give every speaker an informative name in uppercase letters (SPEAKER A, SPEAKER B , YOUNG GIRL, OLD MAN IN A JACKET,  etc.).
If speech is mumbled or something is unclear then state it as it is.
- Visual:
Describe the overall scene.
Include every character's facial expressions, subtext and emotions.
don't forget to state the various props.
- Captions:
Look for unique caption text that appears on the screen.
no need to repeat subtitles.
all Captions must be mentioned in square brackets.
Different colored subtitles usually mean that there are different speakers in the scene.

return a movie script in the following format and style:
YOUNG GIRL: "Wow, this shirt fits me!"
[NEW HELLO KITTY SHIRT]
a YOUNG GIRL is excited about a shirt that is handed to her by BOY WITH BLUE HAT.
BOY WITH BLUE HAT: "Yeah sure it's a gift"

don't make things up!
state the genre of the TikTok video and if it has sound or not.
make sure the Audio is synchronized with the Visual and the Captions (no need to mark timestamps)
If present, try to mark different speakers using all 3 elements (audio, visual and captions).
don't start your response with "Sure! Here's a movie script of the given TikTok video:" and don't finish if with "Hope that helps"
