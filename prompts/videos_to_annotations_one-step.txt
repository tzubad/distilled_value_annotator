you are given a tiktok movie

The task consists of annotating TikTok posts for the 19 refined human values as identified by
Schwartz (1992) and Schwartz et al. (2012). Human values represent guiding principles in
people’s lives. Basic human values are recognized across all cultures and are therefore useful
to understand the principles being conveyed in various social media contexts.
Annotations are to be made at the TikTok post level. This includes the video, the video&
caption, the sound track, and the wording and other visual elements layered on the video. It
is possible that a post will portray several values. In this case, all of them will be marked. It is
also possible that some of the values will be more dominant then others. If a value is
dominant it will be marked as 2, if a value appears in the post but is not dominant it will be
marked as 1. If a value does not appear in the post, it will be marked zero. If the content of
the post is contrary to a value, it will be marked as -1.

order and stability in society are important, including economic stability (employment, no
recession). Importantly, the value refers not only to a society as a whole but also to socially
defined groups like women, parents, etc. within a society. In contrast to the value of
UNIVERSALISM-CONCERN, the value emphasises protection more from a motivation of
“preventing”, “averting”, ”ending” dangers or threats and “preserving” security and stability.

BENEVOLENCE – DEPENDABILITY
Personal motivation: Be loyal to close ones, be dependable and trustworthy, especially to
close ones (in-group). Be seen as reliable, others should have confidence in you helping close
ones.
A key difference between BENEVOLENCE and UNIVERSALISM is that BENEVOLENCE is primarily targeted
towards close ones, and not towards strangers
Examples 1-2:
A beauty influencer sharing their tips for beauty routine to help their followers maintain a and productive beauty routine, encouraging them to trust their experience.
An influencer sharing their trip plans to enrich their followers knowledge
Value label: 1 or 2 depending on other values in the posts, and the dominance of the action
in the post.

Value label: -1
Example 4:

BENEVOLENCE – CARING
Personal motivation: Help and care about close ones, be responsive to family and friends.
Actively helping and taking care of someone close.
A key difference between BENEVOLENCE - CARING and DEPENDABILITY is that the CARING dimension is
active about doing something, while the DEPENDABILITY is more about the perception of being
there for someone, being trustworthy etc. Furthermore, caring here is not generic or
universal, it is limited to specific persons or a delineated in-group within a person’s
immediate environment. This last aspect distinguishes BENEVOLENCE – CARING from UNIVERSALISM-
CONCERN. Similar to the two sides of security, the decisive difference between BENEVOLENCE –
CARING and UNIVERSALISM-CONCERN is to whom the value refers. In case of individuals, family, and
friends, it is BENEVOLENCE – CARING. In contrast, when it is applied to any social group or people
in general, it is UNIVERSALISM-CONCERN. Thus, BENEVOLENCE – CARING will most likely not appear often
in the text only if speaking of individual experiences.
Example 1:
An influencer is shown helping his/her friends or family in need (taking care of sick close
ones, helping them with tasks etc).
An influencers talks about how much his family and friends are important to him
Value label: 1 or 2 depending on other values in the posts, and the dominance of the action
in the post.
Gamer kills his/her gaming squad
Value label: -1
Influencer nags at a sibling
Value label: -1
UNIVERSALISM – CONCERN
Personal motivation: Protecting the weak and vulnerable, care about equal opportunities,
treat everyone justly. In contrast to the value of SECURITY – SOCIETAL, protection and caring also
goes beyond society boundaries. It is more generic referring to all kinds of people/ groups.
Moreover, UNIVERSALISM-CONCERN focuses more on caring, protecting, promoting well-being,
especially of vulnerable people from a motivation of “empathy”, “helping” or “a universal
justice perspective”, whereas SECURITY – SOCIETAL focuses on protecting, promoting well-being
more from a motivation of “preventing”, “averting”, “ending” dangers or threats and
“preserving” security and stability.
Example:
An influencer shown supporting the cause of educating children in third world country.
Value label: 1 or 2 depending on other values in the posts, and the dominance of the action
in the post.

UNIVERSALISM - NATURE
Personal motivation: Care about nature for nature’s sake, protect the environment against
pollution, destruction and other threats.
Examples 1-2:
An influencer is raising money for cleaning the ocean from plastic
An influencer is shown demonstrating against pollution.
Value label: 1 or 2 depending on other values in the posts, and the dominance of the action
in the post.
Example 3:
Influencer throws trash while hiking
Value label: -1
UNIVERSALISM – TOLERANCE
Personal motivation: Care about peace and harmony, listen to people with other views,
understand even those one disagrees with.
The key point here is that it is peace for harmony’s sake and not for the protection of the
weak, which is covered in UNIVERSALISM - CONCERN already.
Example 1:
An influencer incorporates in their post a person with special needs and tells their story- conveying the message of acceptance
Value label: 1 or 2 depending on other values in the posts, and the dominance of the action
in the post.
Example
Influencer asking people if they want him to chase away black people from their surroundings
Value label: -1


Additional guidelines:
No keyword-based annotation: Single words should not be annotated automatically
as value. Only values resulting from the context are annotated. For example, if
someone says the word responsible – it does not necessarily mean benevolence-
dependability. It can also be other values, for example security personal in the
context of responsibility for one’s physical well-being.
You are coding the content of the post, not the fact that the post was created. So,
not all posts are conveying self-direction because they were creatively created. Not
all posts are conveying power because they promote the influencer. Look for the
content of the specific post.
Avoid making ideological judgements- It is hard to disassociate ourselves from our
political, social and academic views, but annotators should try to stay as close to the
meaning conveyed by the influencer as possible, as the goal is to annotate what is
posted, not how it makes us as annotators feel.


Sometimes the influencer portrays different values, even conflicting or opposite. In
this cases- all values in the post will be annotated.
Sometimes few characters in the videos portrays different values, they may be
conflicting or opposite values- all the values that are shown in the video will be
annotated. However, the main character in the video is the influencer. If the post
refers to multiple points of view, the influencer should be taken as the lead. For
example, if the influencer is ordered to conform to the rules by their mother, and
chooses to disobey the rules, the code of conformity rules will be -1.


It is important to stay as close as possible to the text. Even if a follow-up sentence
may cast doubt on the meaning of a value or invites for further interpretation, we
still want to highlight the value as expressed in that specific section. The idea behind
this is that, even if a later part of the text may change the interpretation, it has still
made the connection between an issue and a value to begin with; it has made it
salient so the understanding will be triggered in the reader. In other words, the
value is already salient. Secondly, the reference quality mentioned in the examples is
indicated.

There is always some value in the video, dont return empty answers.
