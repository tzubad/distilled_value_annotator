# Video Annotation Pipeline Configuration - One-Step Mode
# This file demonstrates the one-step mode that processes videos directly to annotations
# without generating intermediate movie scripts.

# Google Cloud Storage Configuration
gcs:
  # Name of the GCS bucket containing videos and where outputs will be saved
  bucket_name: "videos-scripts-and-annotations"
  
  # Path prefix in the bucket where video files are located
  # Videos should be in MP4 format
  video_source_path: "videos/POC_videos"
  
  # script_output_path is not needed for one-step mode
  
  # Full path (including filename) where the final CSV output will be saved
  csv_output_path: "output/POC_results/one_step_result.csv"

# LLM Model Configuration
model:
  # Vertex AI model name to use for video-to-annotation
  # Recommended: gemini-1.5-pro-002 or gemini-2.5-pro
  name: "gemini-2.5-pro"
  
  # Maximum number of retry attempts for failed API calls
  # Uses exponential backoff between retries
  max_retries: 4
  
  # Base delay in seconds for retry backoff calculation
  # Actual delay = retry_delay * (2 ^ attempt) + random(0, 1)
  retry_delay: 40
  
  # Delay in seconds between consecutive API requests
  # Helps avoid rate limiting issues
  request_delay: 3

# Pipeline Execution Configuration
pipeline:
  # Pipeline mode:
  #   - "one_step": Direct video to annotations (no intermediate scripts)
  #   - "two_step": Traditional video -> script -> annotations flow
  mode: "one_step"
  
  # Note: 'stage' and 'save_scripts' settings are ignored in one-step mode
  # They only apply to two-step mode

# Safety Settings for LLM
# Options: BLOCK_NONE, BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH, BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE, BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE
safety_settings:
  harassment: "BLOCK_NONE"
  hate_speech: "BLOCK_NONE"
  sexually_explicit: "BLOCK_NONE"
  dangerous_content: "BLOCK_NONE"
